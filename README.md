# Introduction to Computer Graphics

Introduces necessary background, fundamental concepts, and basic algorithms of Computer Graphics, including human visual perception, representation of colour and images, representation of 2D and 3D spaces, manipulation, movement and drawing of 2D and 3D objects. Students will use an appropriate modern programming language to investigate many of the ideas presented in the lectured material.

### Course content
The course has four components:
1. Programming: To teach you how to use a Java-based graphics language, Processing, to consolidate what you learnt in COMP 102, COMP 112 or DSDN 142. To teach you something about algorithm design, especially about ways to optimise an algorithm.
2. Behind the scenes: Detailed consideration of a range of fundamental computer graphics algorithms that allow you to understand what a graphics card does when it draws. The algorithms include: line drawing, curve drawing, triangle filling, and clipping to the boundary of a window.
3. Underlying mathematics. Algebraic representations of lines and curves. Vectors, matrices, representation of transforms using matrices. Algebra for line-line intersection and closest-point-to-a-line calculation.
4. Fundamental concepts in human vision, colour representation and display design: so that you know the limitations of what we do and why those limitations exist.

### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Write simple programs in the Processing programming language
2. Understand, be able to explain and reproduce a range of fundamental computer graphics algorithms, including line drawing, triangle drawing, clipping, and curve drawing.
3. Understand and use the vector and matrix representations in homogenous co-ordinate systems, to perform geometric transformations.
4. Understand and explain the human visual system, its limitations, and the implications these limitations have on epresentations of colour, display resolution, and quantisation. Describe a number of colour spaces and their relative merits. Explain the basics of the key display technologies in current use.
